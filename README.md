Particle effect in Folder.exe
===

hi everyone I am writing after long time. I had been working on my academic project Folder.exe. It is a game designing project.The most interesting class of my project is "Particle", It is used when enemies are attacked by the player and get disintegrated in small particles.
Here is the screenshot of my particle effect used on enemies

In this Screenshot we can see when an enemy is attacked by the player, its health bar is shown and small particles coming out from the body of the virus. It make it appear that virus is breaking into pieces.

This Game is about a geek guy, whom the player have to control, whose computer is being attacked by the viruses, these viruses will eat up all the information of folders. The Player is the owner of the folder and those folders are very important for him to save or recover them. To save his folders he will kill the entire incoming virus. To recover and protect his folders he will take help of some power-ups. The bonus points are given at the end of each level, which is equal to the number of folders saved. 

### Enemy A.I 
Here viruses are provided very simple A.I. Viruses will chase the folder when virus comes in chasing distance of the folder. Viruses will also run away from the player, when the player comes closer to the enemies. 

### Power-Ups 
The RED cross sign appears after some interval of time in the game, which symbolizes power-ups. The player can use this power-ups to recover the folders. This power-ups are symbolizing antivirus which can heal our folders.
